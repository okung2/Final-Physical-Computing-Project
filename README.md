# Cymatic Study

This repository contains the source code, DXF files, and pictures to replicate a study on cymatics.

# Goal

This project was made for the final assignment for Physical Computing Studio. The goal was to create a physical and interactive object or experience. I decided to further study sound in relation to motion.

# Process

I started the process by looking on Creative Applications to gain inspiration for project ideas. I became interested in actuating motion related to sound. I wanted to create a cymatic-like experience. I also wanted to incorporate an interactive component to the cymatic-like experience, so I corresponded the distance of the user with a tone. The distance of the user was read by the ultrasonic range sensor. Depending on the frequency played, the material placed on the speaker reacted in different ways. I wanted to test out multiple materials on the speaker, so in the video there are preliminary shots when I was testing the different materials. I chose to make the overall product to be small enough to fit on top of a desk due to the size and scale of the sensor and speakers.
